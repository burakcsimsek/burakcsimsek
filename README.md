Hello, this is Burak Can Simsek.

I am a industrial engineer currently living in Istanbul and working for Kopitek Kopyalama Sistemleri as the Business Development Specialist. 
In general, I develop my software with the goal of automating my work within the company and minimizing human error.

Although Javascript has a special place in my mind, I want to improve myself in C#.
